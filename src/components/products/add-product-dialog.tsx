// This component is a bit of a workaround to connect the ProductFormDialog (for adding)
// with the ProductList on the ProductsPage. Ideally, this state management would be
// more robust (e.g. using React Context, Zustand, or relying purely on server data refetching).
// For this example, it demonstrates how a new product added via dialog can update a local list.

export function AddProductDialog() {
  // This state is local to AddProductDialog and won't directly affect ProductList on ProductsPage
  // unless ProductList is also made to consume a shared state or refetch.
  // The onProductSaved prop in ProductFormDialog is the key.
  // We'll rely on the ProductList itself to manage its state based on server actions.
  // This component primarily just needs to trigger the form.

  const handleProductSaved = (newProduct: Product) => {
    // In a real app, if ProductList is on the same page, this might trigger a re-render
    // or a refetch if data fetching is tied to a dependency that changes.
    // For now, we rely on server actions updating the "source of truth" and
    // ProductList re-rendering due to state changes or parent re-render.
    // The `onProductSaved` in `ProductFormDialog` is called by that dialog.
    // Here, this function is a placeholder as the state update logic for the list
    // should reside in the list component itself or its parent page.
    // The ProductList on ProductPage will need to re-fetch or update its state.
    // For this demo, ProductList will manage its own state after successful action.
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      // A simple way to notify the page to re-render or refetch products,
      // not ideal for production but works for demo.
      // A better approach would be to use a state management library or React Context.
